maurs (deprecated)
==================

AUR package helper written in Erlang. This development repo is now deprecated; I originally thought that using Erlang for this project would be an awesome choice, and it was. However, I disliked the way it interfaces to the OS and ultimately deemed it a poor choice as the VM only got in the way of making it suitable for providing a convenient interface to a system administration tool for the end user.

NOTICE: I've reinitialized this project at: https://github.com/eazar001/maurs

It is a work in progress and will be updated and maintained whenever my spare time permits me.
